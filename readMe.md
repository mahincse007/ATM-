E-ATM

This simple project will essentially create a simulation of an ATM within a Windows Console App. Just like an ATM, the program should have at least the following features:

    Check whether an input â€“ card number - is recorded correctly.
    Verifying user by asking for a PIN number.
    In case of negative verification, logging out user.
    In case of positive verification, showing three options : check account balance, cash withdrawal and exit.
    Give user ability to withdraw up to $1000 worth of cash in one transaction with total transactions limited to 3 per day.

card numbers = [1, 2 ,3]

pin numbers = [123, 234, 456 ]

balance = [500, 200, 800]

 

Sample program behavior

what is your card number : 1

pin number : 123

what do you want to do: 1

enter amount: 200

Cash withdrawal successful. Your account balance is 300

Do you want to quit?

If the user doesnt quit, take to the step of balance check or cash withdrawal.
